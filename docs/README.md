# Documentation

The header file(s) in [include/perturb](../include/perturb/perturb.hpp) has all the docstrings. Doxygen is used to collect these and spit out a static site.

The documentation can be found [here][perturb-docs].

## Building

Just navigate to this directory and run `doxygen`. The site should be in the `html/` folder.
